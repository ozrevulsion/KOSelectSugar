# KoSelectSugar
KOSelectSugar is a Knockout.js plugin which allows for lazy loading of select options from sources outside of the original viewmodel at anytime after the model has been bound to the DOM.

### The problem that KoSelectSugarSolves

KoSelectSugar provides a way in which we can load these options into a single observable, have them bind to a select, and only keep track of the selected value because, after all, in most cases that's all we care about!

You can see here the very early stages of development of KOSelectSugar and I have yet to build in a large number of it's core features. I have setup milestones so you can track my progress on this project, so please check back if you've found this before v1 is released and you are interested in this plugin.
